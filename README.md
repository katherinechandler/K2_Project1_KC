# K2_Project1_KC

This project uses statistical hypothesis testing to determine if the canonically accepted mean human body temperature value of 98.6F is statistically different from a sample population mean. The data set includes information about the test subjectâ€™s sex, and the relationship between sex and body temperature is also explored.

This repository consists of a Jupiter notebook and HTML document containing the analysis code and commentary, as well as two stand alone python scripts that run and print the output of a manual t-test calculation and the built-in scipy t-test.
